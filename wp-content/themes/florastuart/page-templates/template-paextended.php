						<span class="question">What compensation is available in a semi wreck injury case?</span><!-- question -->
						<span class="answer">In trucking injury cases, multiple parties could be held liable for your injuries. An experienced truck wreck attorney can help you find all the negligent parties and seek full compensation for your injuries. In any commercial truck collision injury case, your recovery should take into account the immediate needs of you and your family as well as all future expenses including medical bills, rehabilitation or therapy, lost earning capacity, and long-term care, if needed. Victims may also be entitled to seek punitive damages, pain and suffering, and other compensation against the at-fault parties. In some cases, the victimâ€™s family can seek restitution for loss of consortium (companionship) or a wrongful death claim if the injuries lead to the passing of their loved one. Contact us 24/7 if you are the victim of a semi-injury.</span><!-- answer -->
